        <p>Mugdho was born one of twins, one minute after his brother Snigdho. He had an elder brother, Dipto. Mugdho's father was a health inspector from Brahmanbaria municipality. As a child, he was a Bangladesh Scout. He played football and was planning a trip around Bangladesh at the time of his death.

          Mugdho obtained his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Khulna University in 2023. After that, he began his MBA at Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP), in Dhaka city. He was a freelancer, earning about $2,000-3,000 a month.</p>

        <p>On 18 July 2024, Mugdho set out to distribute food and water to the protestors. His twin brother Snigdho was planning to come with him, but Mugdho asked him not to. He began distributing food and water at 4 pm. In a video recorded fifteen minutes before his death, he is seen distributing water bottles and boxes of biscuits to protestors. Around 5 pm, when he was at the side of the road, he was shot at Azampur intersection in Uttara. The bullet entered through his forehead and exited through the right side of his head. His body was taken to Uttara Crescent Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

          Snighdo was the first of Mugdho's family to learn of Mugdho's death and to see his brother's body. The rest of his family, who were in Cox's Bazar on holiday, learned of their son's death on next day morning.</p>

        <p>Mugdho's death is considered one of the most notable deaths that occurred during the Student–People's uprising and created much discussion in social and political circles. His death was seen as a symbolic event in the uprising that became a symbol among the agitators. Soon after his death, the video of him distributing water and biscuits, posted by his twin brother, went viral on social media.

          Freelance marketplace Fiverr offered its condolences on Facebook for his death. The Minister of Education Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury also visited the home of Mugdho's family to give condolences following his death.
          
          "Mugdho" named water bottles were also distributed in a post-revolution cartoon festival. In August 2024, Bangabandhu Mukta Mancha, located in Uttara, Dhaka, was renamed as Mugdho Mancha in his memory.</p>
